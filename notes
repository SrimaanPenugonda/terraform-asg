variable declaration in terraform is painful process
we should declare variables in root module as well as sub module
for example .. ENV,bucket,COMPONENT etc
in this case variables declared in frontend(vars.tf) and assigned values at dev.tfvars and passed these
variables to submodule asg,
In asg again we should declare variables in asg(vars.tf) and access here in sub module asg
